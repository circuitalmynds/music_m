ðŸŽ¤ Lyrics: When I Look At You - Miley Cyrus

Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the nights are long

'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

Yeah when my world is falling apart
When there's no light
To break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

When I look at you
I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

Yeah when my world is falling apart
When there's no light
To break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you

When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that cover me
All I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

I look at you
Yeah,
Whoa-oh,
You appear just like a dream to me

Lyrics:
Baby. there's just one thing
One thing that does it
Does it for me
Baby. we'll find a way
We'll go out
Out for a day
And I want it so bad! it's the first thing I see when I wake
So bad! it's the first thing I see when I wake
Oooho Baby. there's just one thing
One thing that does it
Does it for me
Baby. we'll find a way
We'll go out
Out for a day
And I want it so bad! it's the first thing I see when I wake
So bad! it's the first thing I see when I wake
